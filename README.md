# Discord.js-v13-commandhandler
An advanced command handler adapted from reconlx command handler and upgraded with more feature such as permission handler, emoji handler and more!!


# Some common Faq's
-> How can I change bot prefix??
You can change your prefix from the config.json file..

-> Will my bot token be compromised??
No your bot token won't be compromised bcz you will be storing it in the client secrets

# How do I make more embeds?
-> Create a new file inside the commands folder, and name it anything with .js at the end.. once you do that, copy the code inside of the command.js file and paste it in your new file. Thats the basic command handler. At the top you can enter 2 times and put "const { MessageEmbed } require ('discord.js') and under async you can add "const Example = New MessageEmbed() and go on after that.. I dont recommend using it unless you have some knowledge in discord.js or use the discord.js docs! If you need help u can join my [Discord](https://ventispurr.cool/discord) for help from me
